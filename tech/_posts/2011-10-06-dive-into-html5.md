[Mark Pilgrim is gone][410] and with him all of his sites and work.

I more than enjoyed his book "Dive into HTML5". It was a bible of transitioning and progressive enhancement back when nobody was certain about the direction of HTML working groups and browser support. It helped me learn about the semantics of new elements, playing video without Flash, local storage, offline apps, manipulating browser history, and more. It helped me appreciate feature-detection with JavaScript instead of browser sniffing. It encouraged me to stop worrying and just go forward with all this exciting new stuff.

Mark Pilgrim left, but this book still lives on. Unfortunately, now there's no official resource where people can go to read the book online or download it in PDF format. There are many mirrors of the official site and some PDFs circulating the Web, but they are hideous. They don't contain original typefaces, the cross-references aren't clickable, page breaks are in unfortunate places, etc.

Long ago, when Why the Lucky Stiff disappeared in a similar fashion, [I saved his Poignant Guide to Ruby and re-published it online][poignant]. It has since become the canonical resource when people search for it.

Today, I'm republishing Mark Pilgrim's [Dive into HTML5][dive]. I've also created a beautiful PDF eBook from it:

[<img width="916" alt="PDF preview" src="/images/Dive-into-HTML5-preview.png">][pdf]

The eBook has an embedded table of contents, working cross-references, well-placed page breaks and tons of others tiny tweaks and enhancements. It looks great on iPad. I hope you will enjoy it on your device, too.
