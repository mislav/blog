Every line of code comes with a hidden piece of documentation.

Whoever wrote line 4 of the following code snippet decided to access the
`clientLeft` property of a DOM node for some reason, but do nothing with the
result. It's pretty mysterious. Can you tell why they did it, or is it safe to
change or remove that call in the future?

{% highlight js hl_lines=4 linenos %}
// ...
if (duration > 0) this.bind(endEvent, wrappedCallback)

this.get(0).clientLeft

this.css(cssValues)
{% endhighlight %}

If someone pasted you this code, like I did here, you probably won't be able to
tell who wrote this line, what was their reasoning, and is it necessary to keep
it. _However_, most of the time when working on a project you'll have access to
its history via version control systems.

**A project's history is its most valuable documentation.**

The mystery ends when we view the commit message which introduced this line:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git show $(git blame example.js -L 4,4 | awk '{print $1}')
{% endhighlight %}

As it turns out, this line—more specifically, the _change_ which introduced this
line—is **heavily documented** with information about why it was necessary, why did
the previous approach (referred to by a commit SHA) not work, which browsers are
affected, and a link for further reading.

So does _every other line_ in the project have documentation, going back to the
first day when the project was created. The quality of this documentation,
however, relies heavily on the diligence of the people involved while writing
commit messages.

## Effective spelunking of project's history

### git blame

I've already demonstrated how to use `git blame` from the command line above.
When you don't have access to the local git repository, you can also open the
"Blame" view for [any file on GitHub](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blame/2ed0123eaddc023a8579df0a3a084a70a392d792/src/fx.js#L90).

A very effective way of exploring a file's history is with Vim and [Fugitive][]:

1. Use `:Gblame` in a buffer to open the blame view;
2. If you need to go deeper, press <kbd>Shift-P</kbd> on a line of blame pane to
   re-blame at the parent of that commit;
3. Press <kbd>o</kbd> to open a split showing the commit currently selected in
   the blame pane.
4. Use `:Gbrowse` in the commit split to open the commit in the GitHub web interface;
5. Press <kbd>gq</kbd> to close the blame pane and return to the main buffer.

See `:help Gblame` for more information.

### Find the pull request where a commit originated

With git blame you might have obtained a commit sha that introduced a change,
but commit messages don't always carry enough information or context to explain
the rationale behind the change. However, if the team behind a project practices
[GitHub Flow][], the context might be found in the pull request discussion:

{% highlight bash hl_lines=3 %}
$ git log --merges --ancestry-path --oneline <SHA>..origin | tail
...
bc4712d Merge pull request #42 from sticky-sidebar
3f883f0 Merge branch 'master' into sticky-sidebar
{% endhighlight %}

Here, a single commit SHA was enough to discover that it originated in pull
request #42.

### The git pickaxe

Sometimes you'll be trying to find something that is missing: for instance, a
past call to a function that is no longer invoked from anywhere. The best way to
find which commits have introduced or removed a certain keyword is with the
'pickaxe' argument to `git log`:

    $ git log -S<string>

This way you can dig up commits that have, for example, removed calls to a
specific function, or added a certain CSS classname.

### git churn

It's possible to get valuable insight from history of a project not only by
viewing individual commits, but by **analyzing sets of changes as a whole**. For
instance, [git-churn][] is a simple but valuable script that wraps
`git log` to compile stats about which files change the most. For example, to
see where the development of an app was focused on in the past 6 months:

    $ git churn --since='6 months ago' app/ | tail

Incidentally, such analysis also highlights potential problems with technical
debt in a project. A specific file changing too often is generally a red flag,
since it probably means that the code in that file either needed to be
frequently fixed for bugs, or that the file holds too much responsibility in
general and should be split into smaller units.

Similar methods of history analysis can be employed to see which people were
responsible recently for development of a certain part of the codebase. For
instance, to see who contributed most often to the API part of an application:

    $ git log --format='%an' --since='6 months ago' app/controllers/api/ | \
        sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head

## Being on the right side of history

Keep in mind that everything that you're making today is going to enter the
project's history and stay there forever. To be nicer to other people who work
with you (even if it's a solo project, that includes yourself in 3 months),
follow these ground rules when making commits:

* Always write commit messages as if you are **explaining the change** to a
  colleague sitting next to you who has no idea of what's going on. Per
  [Thoughtbot's tips for better commit messages][tips]:

  > Answer the following questions:
  >
  > * Why is this change necessary?
  > * How does it address the issue?
  > * What side effects does this change have?
  > * Consider including a link [to the discussion.]

* **Avoid unrelated changes in a single commit**. You might have spotted a typo
  or did tiny code refactoring in the same file where you made some other changes,
  but resist the temptation to record them together with the main change unless
  they're directly related.

* **Always be cleaning up your history before pushing**. If the commits haven't
  been shared yet, it's safe to [rebase the heck out of them][rebase]. The
  following could have been permanent history of the Faraday project, but I
  squashed it down to only 2 commits and edited their messages to hide the fact
  I had troubles setting the script up in the first place:

  <img width=470 style="max-width:100%" alt="messy git history before rebase"
    src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2U0d0K2Q2C300Q1X3P1S/Image%202013-04-04%20at%201.38.33%20AM.png">

* Corollary of avoiding unrelated changes: **stick to a line-based coding
  style** that allows you to append, edit or remove values from lists without
  changing adjacent lines. Some examples:

        var one = "foo"
          , two = "bar"
          , three = "baz"   // Comma-first style allows us to add or remove a
                            // new variable without touching other lines

        # Ruby:
        result = make_http_request(
          :method => 'POST',
          :url => api_url,
          :body => '...',   // Ruby allows us to leave a trailing comma, making it
        )                   // possible to add/remove params while not touching others

  Why would you want to use such coding styles? Well, always think about the
  person who's going to `git blame` this. In the JavaScript example, if you were
  the one who added a committed the value `"baz"`, you don't want your name to
  show up when somebody blames the line that added `"bar"`, since the two
  variables might be unrelated.

## Bonus script

Since you've read this far, I'll reward you with an extra script. I call it
[git-overwritten][] and it shows blame information about original authors of
lines changed or removed in a given branch:

    $ git overwritten feature origin/master

<pre class='ansi'>  28 2014-02-04 <span class='ansi-0 ansi-yellow'>1fb2633</span>  <span class='ansi-0 ansi-green'>Mislav Marohnić</span>: Add Makefile for building and testing
   1 2014-01-13 <span class='ansi-0 ansi-yellow'>b2d896a</span>  <span class='ansi-0 ansi-green'>Jingwen Owen Ou</span>: Add -t to mktemp in script/make
  17 2014-01-07 <span class='ansi-0 ansi-yellow'>385ccee</span>  <span class='ansi-0 ansi-green'>Jingwen Owen Ou</span>: Add script/make for homebrew build
</pre>

This is useful when opening pull requests per [GitHub Flow]; you'll want your
pull request reviewed by colleagues but you might not be sure who to ping. With
`git-overwritten` you'll get the names of people who wrote the lines you just
changed, so you'll know who to @-mention when opening a pull request.
