I've had an *off/on relationship* with Vim for the past many years.

Before, I never felt like we understood each other properly. Vim is
almost useless without plugins and some essential settings in <code
class="file">.vimrc</code>, but fiddling with all the knobs and
installing all the plugins that I thought I needed was a process that in
the end streched out from few hours to weeks, months even; and it the
end it just caused frustration instead of making me a happier coder.

Recently, I decided to give Vim another shot.  This time around it was
different – someting in my brain switched and now for the first time in
my life I'm proud of my knowledge of Vim. My philosophy of it has changed
to "less is more", my approach was more disciplined and my motivation
stronger. And so you don't spend as much time learning as I did, I am
going to lay down some fundamentals.

## Start with a basic setup – but not zero

I learned this the hard way: you shouldn't start with a huge
<code class="file">.vimrc</code> file that you copied from someone else
nor should you install every single plugin that seems useful at that
moment.

This is a good starting point for your <code class="file">.vimrc</code>:

{% highlight vim %}
set nocompatible
syntax enable
set encoding=utf-8
set showcmd                     " display incomplete commands

"" Whitespace
set nowrap                      " don't wrap lines
set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2      " a tab is two spaces
set expandtab                   " use spaces, not tabs
set backspace=indent,eol,start  " backspace through everything in insert mode

"" Searching
set hlsearch                    " highlight matches
set incsearch                   " incremental searching
set ignorecase                  " searches are case insensitive...
set smartcase                   " ... unless they contain at least one capital letter
{% endhighlight %}

### Guidelines for expanding your vim settings later on:

1. Never copy something from other people unless you know *exactly* what
   that particular setting is doing and you recognize that you've needed
   it before.
2. Don't use too many plugins; start with 3-5 and add others as your
   skill progresses. Use [Pathogen][] for managing them.
3. Overly eager plugins like [Syntastic][] can actually *hurt* your
   development even when you're not actively using them. Zap such
   offenders quickly.
4. Discover your Vim heroes and periodically check how they have set
   their editor up. A lot of people publish their dotfiles on GitHub.

Don't use [Janus][]. It's a community maintained vim configuration
project that in theory sounds nice, but once you start using it it's
anything but that. The current version of Janus installs harmful
plugins such as Syntastic and adds tons of opinionated mappings and
piles of hacks on top of one another. The "experimental" version of
Janus is a rewrite that's meant to be more configurable, but in fact
it's just more fragmented and harder to follow what's going on. You
should be in charge of your <code class="file">.vimrc</code> and always
know what's going on, but with Janus you're not.

## Find your killer features

Right from the start, you'll need to discover some sweet power moves
that'll keep you returning to Vim rather than your old editor.

Vim has two main modes you need to care about first: the *normal mode*
(where you move, perform commands) and the *insert mode* (where you type
in text). The insert mode is on the surface nothing special when
compared to your old editor: you press <kbd>i</kbd>, you're in insert
mode, now you type text as your normally would. Pressing
<kbd>&lt;Esc&gt;</kbd> exits back to normal mode.

But it is *how* you enter insert mode that can gain you some advantage:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>i</kbd>
    <td>insert before character under cursor
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>a</kbd>
    <td>insert after cursor
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>I</kbd>
    <td>insert before the first non-blank character in the current line
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>A</kbd>
    <td>insert at end of the line
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>o</kbd>
    <td>starts insert mode in a new line below current one
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>O</kbd>
    <td>insert in a new line above current one
</table>

You can also enter insert mode by replacing existing text at the same
time:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>ciw</kbd>
    <td>("change inner word") change word under cursor
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>ci"</kbd>
    <td>change double-quoted string (but keep the quotes)
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>ci(</kbd>
    <td>change text between matching parentheses, also works with brackets
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>cc</kbd>
    <td>change whole line
</table>

These shortcuts are a very compelling argument why Vim is more efficient
at *editing* code than most editors, but they are just the tip of the
iceberg of all the things possible with different motions.

For more information, see <kbd>:help change.txt</kbd>.

## Learn to move

In Vim, efficient movement is everything. After all, most of your time
is spent *editing*, not inserting text and code. Commands for selecting,
changing, moving and transforming text all follow the same motion
rules, thus making them fundamental in knowing Vim.  For example, in the
<kbd>ciw</kbd> command mentioned previously, the <kbd>iw</kbd> is a
motion that means "inner word".

Since there are too many different motions to remember at once, you'll
need some sort of a mnemonic to help you while learning.

### The best Vim cheat sheet you'll ever use

Do an [image search for "vim cheat sheet"][search] and you'll
quickly hate life. But not all of them are ugly – there is a smart
[wallpaper originally designed by Ted Naleid][ted] and [re-worked with
smoother colors][cheatsheet]:

[![vim motion keys](https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/img/57cc2998508eb2c6f0b46b265354e6dda3145757/687474703a2f2f696d673835302e696d616765736861636b2e75732f696d673835302f373533372f62696c6473636869726d666f746f323031313034303275672e706e67)][bigimg]

I don't actually use it as a wallpaper; while learning I've kept it open
in a separate window and switch to it whenever I needed to remind myself
of what kind of motions are there.

### Knowing where you want to go

When you think about it, you always know where you want to position your
cursor before editing – if you can describe your intent to Vim, you can
perform it faster than hitting cursor keys repeatedly or even using the
mouse. In general:

* If you repeatedly (more than 2-3 times in a row) hit cursor keys to
  get somewhere, there is a better way.
* If you press backspace more than a couple of times to delete text,
  there is a better way.
* If you find yourself performing the same changes on several lines,
  there is a better way.

Here's an overview of several useful methods for navigating your
document, with 2nd column indicating the corresponding backwards
movement:

<table class="split reverse">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th title="forward">→
      <th title="backward">←
      <th>description
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>/</kbd>
    <th><kbd>?</kbd>
    <td>search for a pattern of text, jump to it by hitting Enter (<kbd>&lt;CR&gt;</kbd>)
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>*</kbd>
    <th><kbd>#</kbd>
    <td>search for the word under cursor
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>n</kbd>
    <th><kbd>N</kbd>
    <td>jump to the next match for the previous search
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>$</kbd>
    <th><kbd>^</kbd>
    <td>position cursor at end of current line
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>f</kbd>
    <th><kbd>F</kbd>
    <td>position cursor on the character in the same line that matches the next keystroke
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>t</kbd>
    <th><kbd>T</kbd>
    <td>position cursor <em>before</em> the next character that matches the keystroke
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>;</kbd>
    <th><kbd>,</kbd>
    <td>repeat the last <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>t</kbd>, or <kbd>T</kbd>
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>w</kbd>
    <th><kbd>b</kbd>
    <td>move to start of next word
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>W</kbd>
    <th><kbd>B</kbd>
    <td>move to start of next "WORD" (sequence of non-blank characters)
  <tr>
    <th><kbd>}</kbd>
    <th><kbd>{</kbd>
    <td>move down one paragraph (block of text separated by blank lines)
  <!--<tr>
    <th><kbd>&lt;C-f&gt;</kbd>
    <th><kbd>&lt;C-b&gt;</kbd>
    <td>move down one page-->
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2><kbd>gg</kbd>
    <td>jump to first line of document
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2><kbd>G</kbd>
    <td>jump to end of document
</table>

To me, the killer ones on this list are "word", "WORD" and paragraph
motions.

One related tip: while in insert mode, <kbd>&lt;C-w&gt;</kbd> deletes
the last word before cursor. This is more efficient than backspacing.

For in-depth documentation on motions, see <kbd>:help motion.txt</kbd>.

### After the jump

Some of the above motions jump, and it is very useful to know how to
backtrack those jumps. From the <kbd>:help jump-motions</kbd>
documentation:

> A "jump" is one of the following commands: `'`, `` ` ``, `G`,
> `/`, `?`, `n`, `N`, `%`, `(`, `)`, `[[`, `]]`, `{`, `}`, `:s`, `:tag`,
> `L`, `M`, `H` and the commands that start editing a new file.  If you
> make the cursor "jump" with one of these commands, the position of the
> cursor before the jump is remembered.

Mastering jumps is insanely powerful. Suppose you edited one line,
exited insert mode and now you are navigating the document to find out
something. Now you want to continue editing from the same spot. The
<kbd>`.</kbd> motion brings the cursor back on the exact place where
the last change was made.

Another example: you are in the middle of a script and need to add some
code, but that needs adding an extra `require` statement (or `import`,
`include`, or similar) near the top of the file. You jump to the top
with <kbd>gg</kbd>, add the `require` statement and jump back to before
the previous jump with <kbd>``</kbd>.

And if you did multiple jumps, you can backtrack with
<kbd>&lt;C-o&gt;</kbd>.

## Quickly navigate files

Real-world projects have more than one file to edit. Efficient switching
between files is just as important as motion commands.

Folks coming from TextMate, IDEs, or gedit will quickly find themselves
craving for a directory tree side pane, and the community is going to
unanimously recomend NERD tree. **Don't use the NERD tree plugin.** It
is clumsy, will *hurt* your workflow with split windows, and it's not
particulary pretty either. *You never needed* a file browser pane in the
first place. The only thing it can be useful for is getting to know the
directory/file structure of a new project, and you can easily cover that
with the `tree` command-line tool (OS X users: install it with
Homebrew).

What you need is a plugin for fuzzy searching of file names in a
project. Look no further than [Command-T][cmdt].

Here are my mappings for starting a file search with Command-T. I
start a project-wide search with <kbd>,f</kbd> and search the directory
of the current file with <kbd>,F</kbd>:

{% highlight vim %}
" use comma as <Leader> key instead of backslash
let mapleader=","

" double percentage sign in command mode is expanded
" to directory of current file - http://vimcasts.org/e/14
cnoremap %% <C-R>=expand('%:h').'/'<cr>

map <leader>f :CommandTFlush<cr>\|:CommandT<cr>
map <leader>F :CommandTFlush<cr>\|:CommandT %%<cr>
{% endhighlight %}

For this to be fast, ensure that you don't have any other mappings that
start with `<leader>f`, otherwise Vim will always force a slight delay
after keystrokes before resolving the mapping. (See all of the current
mappings in effect with <kbd>:map</kbd>.)

In the same session, Vim remembers previously open files. You can list
them with <kbd>:buffers</kbd>. Without even using any plugins, you can
jump to a buffer on this list by typing <kbd>:b</kbd> and a part of a
buffer's name. For example, if you've previously opened
`lib/api_wrapper.rb`, you can return to it with <kbd>:b api</kbd>. Hit
<kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd> to cycle between multiple matches.

To switch between the currently open buffer and the previous one, use
<kbd>&lt;C-^&gt;</kbd>. This key combination is a bit hard to reach, so
you can remap to, for instance, twice hitting `<leader>`:

{% highlight vim %}
nnoremap <leader><leader> <c-^>
{% endhighlight %}

Since my `<leader>` is set to comma, I just have to hit `,,` to
alternate between files, for instance tests and implementation.

### Split windows

You can split the current buffer horizontally or vertically.  This is
useful, for instance, to view simultaneously the top and the bottom part
of the same file. But it's even more useful to view different files in
splits; for instance tests and implementation.

<table class="split">
  <thead><tr>
    <th>where
    <th>horizonal
    <th>vertical
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>normal mode
    <td><kbd>:split</kbd>
    <td><kbd>:vsplit</kbd>
  <tr>
    <th>:CommandT
    <td><kbd>&lt;C-s&gt;</kbd>
    <td><kbd>&lt;C-v&gt;</kbd>
  <tr>
    <th>:Ack
    <td><i>n/a</i>
    <td><kbd>v</kbd>
</table>

To switch cursor between these windows, use <kbd>&lt;C-w&gt;</kbd> (as
in "window") and then *direction*, where direction is one of:
↑<kbd>k</kbd>&nbsp;↓<kbd>j</kbd>&nbsp;←<kbd>h</kbd>&nbsp;→<kbd>l</kbd>.
To ease this navigation, you can use the following mappings so you can
omit the <kbd>&lt;C-w&gt;</kbd> prefix:

{% highlight vim %}
" easier navigation between split windows
nnoremap <c-j> <c-w>j
nnoremap <c-k> <c-w>k
nnoremap <c-h> <c-w>h
nnoremap <c-l> <c-w>l
{% endhighlight %}
